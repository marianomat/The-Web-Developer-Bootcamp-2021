# The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021
Hi! Welcome to the brand new version of The Web Developer Bootcamp, Udemy's most popular web development course.  This course was just completely overhauled to prepare students for the 2021 job market, with over 60 hours of brand new content. This is the only course you need to learn web development. There are a lot of options for online developer training, but this course is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective on the market.  Here's why:

This is the only Udemy course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor with a track record of success.

94% of my in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs. Most of them are complete beginners when I start working with them.

The previous 2 bootcamp programs that I taught cost $14,000 and $21,000.  This course is just as comprehensive but with brand new content for a fraction of the price.

Everything I cover is up-to-date and relevant to 2021's developer job market. This course does not cut any corners. I just spent 8 months redoing this behemoth of a course!

We build 13+ projects, including a gigantic production application called YelpCamp. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application.

The course is constantly updated with new content, projects, and modules.  Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training.

You get to meet my cats and chickens!

When you're learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the "beginner friendly" classes.  With this course, you get the best of both worlds.  This is a course designed for the complete beginner, yet it covers some of the most exciting and relevant topics in the industry.

Throughout the brand new version of the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including:

HTML5

CSS3

Flexbox

Responsive Design

JavaScript (all 2020 modern syntax, ES6, ES2018, etc.)

Asynchronous JavaScript - Promises, async/await, etc.

AJAX and single page apps

DOM Manipulation

This course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many online courses are just a long series of "watch as I code" videos.  This course is different. I've incorporated everything I learned in my years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging. The course includes:

Lectures

Code-Alongs

Projects

Exercises

Research Assignments

Slides

Downloads

Readings
